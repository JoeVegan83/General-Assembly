<h1>Joining in Pandas</h1> 

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Concatenate and Append functions with DataFrames and Series Objects
- Join and Merge operations with DataFrames and Series Objects
- Practice with the above on live data, with basic join relations and validation

## Duration
30 minutes

## Suggested Agenda

|    Time     | Activity |
|-------------|----------|
| 0:00 - 0:08 | concat and append |
| 0:08 - 0:15 | join and merge |
| 0:15 - 0:30 | Student exercises |

## Materials and Preparation
- Send out the presentation link.
- Students will need the data sets and notebook. Consider having a zip file of all notebooks and data sets for the rest of the unit that you hand out at the beginning of this lesson. Alternatively, link them directly in GitHub - remember that they haven't learned GitHub, so you'll need to help them download the files.
- Students will need a basic understanding of SQL joins (left, right, inner, outer, etc). These are not covered in depth in this lesson.
- Validation (one to many, one to one) is briefly covered in the answer key only. This is good to talk about verbally if you have time, but there is no explicit material on it.
- The last two exercise questions don't tell the student what to do - they'll need to use the data dictionary to figure out the join path themselves. Depending on the class, this may be above their heads. Be prepared to help.

## In Class: Materials
- Projector
- Internet connection
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python3
